## How To Use
### 1: Install Python
Get the last [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version. When installing Python, make sure to check "Add Python to PATH"

### 2: Install Python pywebview module
Once Python is installed, we need the pywebview module. Open a terminal : 

(on Windows, Right-Click on the Windows icon, Select "Terminal (Admin)")

In the terminal, write `pip install pywebview` 

if this command doesn'T work, it means you didn't check "Add Python to PATH" as shown in the screenshot.

### 3: Prepare Scripting folder
