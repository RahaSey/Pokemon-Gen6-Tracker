# Pokemon-Gen6-Tracker
Kaizo tracker for the Citra emulator for gen 6 and 7 modified

All Credits to [accruenewblue](https://github.com/accruenewblue) for the [code](https://github.com/accruenewblue/Citra-Tracker), i just made it so you don't need to use your web browser to use the tracker.

## How To Use
### 1: Install Python
Get the last [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version. When installing Python, make sure to check "Add Python to PATH"

### 2: Install Python pywebview module
Once Python is installed, we need the pywebview module. Open a terminal : 

(on Windows, Right-Click on the Windows icon, Select "Terminal (Admin)")

In the terminal, write `pip install pywebview` 

if this command doesn't work, it means you didn't check "Add Python to PATH" as shown in the screenshot.

### 3: Download Tracker
Now that Python is ready, you can Download the [Tracker](https://github.com/RahaSey/Pokemon-Gen6-Tracker/releases/tag/v0.1). Just click on the first zip folder

Extract it where you want your Tracker to be, for example on the Desktop. So you would have "Desktop\Pokemon-Gen6-Tracker-v0.1" for example.

### 4: Download Citra scripting file
The tracker will not work yet. We still need the [citra.py](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra/blob/master/dist/scripting/citra.py) file. Just click on "Download raw file"

You just need to put this file in the extracted Tracker folder, so "Desktop\Pokemon-Gen6-Tracker-v0.1\citra.py"

### 5: Start the Tracker
To start the tracker, you just need to double click on "citra-updater.py". In the tracker, you can move the window, resize the window and Zoom with Ctrl + mouse wheel.

**CAREFUL** : This tracker displays the highest lvl pokemon, so when pivoting, you might see the wrong pokemon for a few level. Also, be careful with the arrows on the tracker, which let you see the opposing pokemon. If the trainer has more than 1 pokemon, you are able to see all of them, so i suggest to only use the right arrow.

### 6: IMPORTANT
This tracker is new and has a few problems, which might take a while to fix. Here are some problems i've had and how to fix:

#### The tracker won't update for some reason
Sometimes, it happens and i'm still not sure why. The easiest fix is to close the Tracker and run it again.

#### The tracker won't update in some specific battles
I'm also not sure why, but some pokemon makes the tracker unhappy and will not update during that battle. Still no fix, just beat him and it will be back to normal.
