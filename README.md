# Pokemon-Gen6-Tracker
Kaizo tracker for gen 6 and 7 modified

All Credits to [accruenewblue](https://github.com/accruenewblue) for the [code](https://github.com/accruenewblue/Citra-Tracker), i just made it so you don't need to use your web browser to use the tracker.

## How To Use
### 1: Install Python
Get the last [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version. When installing Python, make sure to check "Add Python to PATH"

### 2: Install Python pywebview module
Once Python is installed, we need the pywebview module. Open a terminal : 

(on Windows, Right-Click on the Windows icon, Select "Terminal (Admin)")

In the terminal, write `pip install pywebview` 

if this command doesn't work, it means you didn't check "Add Python to PATH" as shown in the screenshot.

### 3: Download Tracker
Now that Python is ready, you can Download the [Tracker](https://github.com/RahaSey/Pokemon-Gen6-Tracker/releases/tag/v0.1). Just click on the first zip folder

Extract it where you want your Tracker to be, for example on the Desktop.

### 4: Download Citra scripting file
